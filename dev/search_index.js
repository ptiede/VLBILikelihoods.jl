Σ can either be a vector or a diagonal matrix.\n\nNotes\n\nWe do no processing to the data, i.e. the mean μ is not-debiased anywhere.\n\nWarning\n\nThis likelihood will be significantly biased from the true Rice distribution for data points with SNR = μ/Σ < 2. If this matter significantly for you, we recommend that you consider fitting pure complex visibilities instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
