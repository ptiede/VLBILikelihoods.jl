One key difference between an AbstractVLBIDistribution and a regular Distributions.jl one is that by default we expect on the fields of the struct defining the distribution to be lognorm which gives the log-normalization constant for the distribution.\n\nThis prevents the model from constantly having to compute the log-normalization constant everytime the density is evaluated, which is often the most expensive part of the computation.\n\nTo implement a AbstractVLBIDistributions a user then just needs to define\n\nunormed_logdensity(d::AbstractVLBIDistribution, x)\n\nwhich takes in the new distribution type d and the point you wish to evaluate the density at. Internally VLBILikelihood adds in the normalization constant.\n\nIf the user wishes to change the default lognorm behavior they can also overload the lognorm function to opt-out of storing the normalization constant in the struct. For example\n\nstruct MyNormal <: AbstractVLBIDistributions end\n\nunnormed_logdensity(d::MyNormal, x) = -x^2/2 lognorm(d::MyNormal) = -log(2π)/2\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#VLBILikelihoods.AmplitudeLikelihood-Tuple{AbstractVector, AbstractVector}","page":"Home","title":"VLBILikelihoods.AmplitudeLikelihood","text":"AmplitudeLikelihood(μ, Σ::Union{AbstractVector, AbstractMatrix})\n\nForms the likelihood for amplitudes from the mean vector μ and the covariance matrix Σ.

The distribution used here is not the exact distribution for closure phases since this becomes quite complicated (especially for correlated covariances). For our approximation we take the Gaussian around the complex exponential of the phase, that is the unormalized likelihood is given by\n\n    logmathcalL = -frac12(e^itheta - e^imu)^TSigma^-1(e^itheta - e^imu)\n\nIf Σ is diagonal then this reduces to a bunch of independent Von Mises distributions, and if Σ is dense, this becomes a complicated multi-variate extension of the Von Mises distribution[1].\n\nParameters\n\nμ: The mean closure phase, which is usually computed from some VLBI model\nΣ: The measurement covariance matrix, which is usually computed directly from the data.      Note that Σ can either be a matrix or a vector. If Σ is a vector then we interpret      Σ to represent the diagonal of the covariance matrix.\n\nwarning: Warning\nNote that for the dense Σ, the likelihood is not normalized properly since the normalization is not analytically tractable. This is not a problem for sampling since the normalizing constant does not depend on μ so it does not usually impact parameter estimation. However, if you are including terms that modify the covariance Σ then this likelihood is wrong and could give biased results. If you want to fit noise terms in Σ please either use the diagonal approximation to the likelihood, or better yet fit complex visibilities directly.\n\n[1]: This distribution is defined on the n torus where n is the number of closure phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#VLBILikelihoods.CoherencyLikelihood","page":"Home","title":"VLBILikelihoods.CoherencyLikelihood","text":"ComplexVisLikelihood(μ::AbstractVector{<:StaticMatrix{2,2}}, Σ::AbstractVector{<:StaticMatrix{2,2, <:Real}})\n\nCreates the coherency matrix likelihood distribution which is a Gaussian over the space of 2×2 complex visibilities.\n\nParamters\n\nμ: The mean coherency matrix stored as a vector of 2x2 static matrices, which is usually computed from some VLBI model\nΣ: The measurement covariance matrix, which is usually computed directly from the data.
