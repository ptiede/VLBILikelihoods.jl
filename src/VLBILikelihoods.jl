"""
    $(TYPEDEF)

Abstract type that detail that the distribution is the likelihood for some VLBI dataproduct.
One key difference between an `AbstractVLBIDistribution` and a regular `Distributions.jl` one
is that by default we expect on the fields of the `struct` defining the distribution to be
`lognorm` which gives the log-normalization constant for the distribution.

This prevents the model from constantly having to compute the log-normalization constant
everytime the density is evaluated, which is often the most expensive part of the computation.

To implement a `AbstractVLBIDistributions` a user then just needs to implement
  - `unormed_logdensity(d::AbstractVLBIDistribution, x)`
which takes in the new distribution type `d` and the point you wish to evaluate the density at.
Internally `VLBILikelihood` add in the normalization constant.

Additionally, if the user wishes to change this behavior they can also overload the `lognorm`
function to opt-out of storing the normalization constant in the `struct`.
